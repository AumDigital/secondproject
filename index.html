       <h3>Yoga Studios</h3>

            <p> Yoga studios are a fantastic place to start your yoga journey. They will have a range of classes for all levels.
             Most studios offer a beginner yoga class where you can learn the fundamentals of a yoga practice consisting of the following basic principals.

                <ul>
                    <li> Basic yoga postures</li>
                    <li> Basic Alignments</li>
                    <li> Breath fundamentals</li>
                </ul>

             Once you feel comfortable with these foundation principals you can move on to more challenging classes and styles, such as:

                <ul>
                    <li> Hatha Yoga </li>
                    <li> Ashtanga Vinyasa </li>
                    <li> Vinyasa Flow </li>
                    <li> Rocket Yoga </li>    
                </ul>

            Above are actual styles of yoga. Each vary in different degrees of difficulty and pace. Hatha yoga is a great place to start for a
            beginner practitioner as the holds are held for much longer, and will give you time to settle into each posture.

    <section class="self-practice" id="self-practice">
       <h3>Self Practice</h3>

            <p> If venturing into a studio with no previous knowledge seems very daunting, I would recommend getting yourself a yoga mat, firing up youtube,
            and starting with a beginner yoga video online. Here are a few links to some good beginner classes:
            
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB3Y-4a3ZrU/li"> Yoga With Adrianne </a></li>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetbSrCW1TQ"> Breathe and Flow Yoga </a></li>
                </ul>

            Once you feel confident in your yoga practice I recommend finding a video you like, make some notes of the postures, and try to follow the practice
            without having the on screen guidance, maybe relying on hand written notes to keep yourself on track. Once you've got it dialled into your memory,
            try to create a self practice from memory. This is where the magic lies, and the full meditative qualities of yoga can be experienced.

        <h3>Yoga Philosophy</h3>

            <p> In traditional practice in the East, yoga philosophy should typically come first in your journey of self inquiry. But here in the west
            we tend to look for the physical results first and then go deeper. That said, whichever way you find yourself looking into the yogic path, here are
            a list of books to deepen your knowledge on yoga philosophy. Some are traditional, and some more new age spiritual philosophy.
            
                <ul>
                    <li> Hatha Yoga Pradipika </li>
                    <li> Light on Yoga</li>
                    <li> The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali </li>
                    <li> The Power of Now </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
